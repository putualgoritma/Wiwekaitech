# Image Assets

This directory contains image assets for the Wiwekaitech website.

## Required Images

### Hero Section
- `hero-dashboard.png` - Screenshot or illustration of ERP dashboard (recommended: 800x600px)

### Projects
- `project-1.png` - Project screenshot 1 (recommended: 600x400px)
- `project-2.png` - Project screenshot 2 (recommended: 600x400px)
- `project-3.png` - Project screenshot 3 (recommended: 600x400px)

## How to Add Images

1. Add your images to this `/public/images/` directory
2. Reference them in components using `/images/filename.png`
3. For Next.js Image optimization, ensure images are in common formats (png, jpg, webp)

## Temporary Placeholders

Until real images are added, the application uses:
- Gradient placeholders with icons for visual appeal
- SVG icons for projects
- Colored backgrounds for missing images
