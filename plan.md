Act as a senior full-stack architect, enterprise UI/UX designer, and SEO strategist.

We are building a COMPLETE, production-ready company website 
for a custom ERP & enterprise software development company.

This is NOT a scaffold.
This is NOT a demo.
This must be a real-world, structured, enterprise-grade project.

You must generate output in this strict order:

PHASE 1 — MASTER ARCHITECTURE PLAN
PHASE 2 — FRONTEND IMPLEMENTATION (COMPLETE)
PHASE 3 — BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION (COMPLETE)

Do not skip phases.
Do not generate placeholders.
Everything must be production-ready and runnable.
